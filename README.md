Sheet Music Player/Creator/Editor in Java
This program plays, creates, and edits sheet music using a GUI in Java. This code was made in 2020 in 1-2 weeks for a final project of 
CS III.

The main file can be found in SheetMusicMain.java. Before running this, you should be sure to compile the rest of the files. You should also be sure to import jfugue-5.0.9.jar into your Java.
